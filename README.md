# Android HTTP Call Monitor 
This project creates a http server that is capable of serving the call data (number, name, duration etc.) to clients on the same
network. It exposes 3 endpoints:
1. `/`  - provides information about the available endpoints
``` json
[
  {
    "name": "log",
    "url": "http://192.168.188.48:8000/log"
  },
  {
    "name": "status",
    "url": "http://192.168.188.48:8000/status"
  }
]
```
2. `/log` - provides the call log information associated with the device that is hosting the server
``` json

  {
    "duration": 21,
    "name": "Camila",
    "number": "+4915622492666",
    "start_date": "Jul 27, 2021 18:35:30",
    "times_queried": 0,
    "type": "INCOMING"
  },
  {
    "duration": 0,
    "name": "Clara",
    "number": "+4913622555664",
    "start_date": "Jul 27, 2021 18:35:13",
    "times_queried": 0,
    "type": "MISSED"
  },
  {
    "duration": 0,
    "name": "Mark",
    "number": "+3368198888888",
    "start_date": "Jul 27, 2021 16:58:30",
    "times_queried": 0,
    "type": "MISSED"
  },
```
3. `/status` - provides the "real time" call status of the device hosting the server
``` json
{
  "number": "+4917644492666",
  "state": "RINGING"
}
```
 
## Getting started
Clone the project and open it with Android Studio (> 4.2.2).

## Running and testing
### Running
You can [build and run](https://developer.android.com/studio/run) the project using the Android Studio/Gradle. To run the app, you'll need an [android emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator) or a [real device](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device).
The minimum SDK required for this application is API level 23 (Android 6.0)
You will also find a [sample apk](RUN_ME.apk) in the root of the project, if you want to skip compiling it yourself.

### Testing
All the unit tests are located in the `/src/test`. The folder structure mirrors the on in the actual classes.
For example, you will find the `CallLogUseCaseTest.kt` in the `src/test/java/com/kaffka/httpserver/domain/usecases/CallLogUseCaseTest.kt`<BR>

To execute the tests you can use the command:
`./gradlew check`
<BR>Another alternative is to run directly from teh Android Studio by using the gutter icon.

## Project structure
The project is divided into 4 main layers:

- `domain` holds the business logic and the data representations that are used across the application. Here, for example, you will find all the domain models and use cases for this application
- `data` holds the repositories, providing an interface with the data layer
- `ui` contains the classes responsible for providing an interface between the user and the application business logic. Here you will find the activities, view models, adapters etc.
= `di` contains dependency injection related files / classes

## Dependencies
- [ktor](https://ktor.io/) - Ktor is an asynchronous framework for creating microservices, web applications, and more. Itâ€™s fun, free, and open source.
- [hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) - Hilt is a dependency injection library for Android that reduces the boilerplate of doing manual dependency injection in your project.
- [room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) - The Room persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite
- [mockk](https://mockk.io/) - mocking library for Kotlin

## Project structure
The project was developed under the influence of [MVVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel) and [Clean architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) ideas and is divided into 4 main packages:

- `domain` holds the data representations that are used across the application.
- `data` is responsible for providing the data through the the exposed repositories
- `ui` contains all view related code, including adapters, activities, fragments and view models
- `di` is responsible to provide the repositories instances for the application

Some notes about the main components in this app:
- `ServerService`, as the name implies, it is a [foreground service](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/foreground-services) responsible for hosting our http server
- `PhoneStatusReceiver`, is a [broadcast receiver](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/broadcasts) responsible for listening for changes in the phone state, such as ringing, incoming or outgoing calls events
- `ServerControlFragment`, the fragment responsible for displaying the call log and enabling the server control (start/stop)

## How to use the app
### Starting 
- [Install](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb#move), make sure you are connected to a wifi network and open the app
- Two permissions are required to enable reading the call log and listening to phone status changes, if you want to use the app you need to agree with both
- After that, you should be able to see the server ip address with a blue button, followed by a list of calls, the button allows you to control the server state.
- Press the "START SERVER" button, the text fo the button should change to "STOP SERVER", and you should see a notification indicating the server is up and running
- In another device, connected to the same wifi network of the device that is running the app, navigate to the specified server address 
- You should get a response containing the available services as the one described at the top of this readme
### Stopping
- To stop the server just open the app again and click the "STOP SERVER" button, the notification should be dismissed, and the server should be no longer accessible
